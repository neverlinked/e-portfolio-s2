                <h2 class="phase-title">Overview</h2>
                <p class="phase-description">Since I was in the same group, I was again assigned with the roles of leader in research, marketing and this time some other tasks like video production.</p>
                <p>I came up with a few ideas for the project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TikTok Videos - As you saw already, I appear to be a TikTok enthusiast, hence this was a must for me in this project.</li>
                    <li>Wallet Flyer - To be honest, I did not invent this, but just saw a funny TikTok video about the idea and sent it to the project group chat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Original idea:</p>

                <p>Final Version:</p>
                <img src="/assets/final_flyer.jpeg" alt="Final Version" class="example-image">
                <p>I also participated in the creation of a Coaster flyer, bus stop poster, and a YouTube ad, but they were mainly handled by my team members. I helped with ideas, scripting, feedback, parts of the design, as well as editing tips for Niki for the YouTube ad.</p>

            <div class="project-phase">
                <h2 class="phase-title">Research Questions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are touristsâ€™ main interests when visiting a place? What persuades them to visit the place?</li>
                    <li>What kind of promotion is the most effective for tourists?</li>
                    <li>What kind of promotion is the most cost efficient for GoodNews?</li>
                    <li>What is lacking in the current marketing strategy of the city of Breda that if implemented would make a huge difference to the traffic of visitors?</li>
                    <li>How can we make our media product appeal and stand out among other marketing products that are targeted for tourists?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-phase">
                <h2 class="phase-title">Research Strategy</h2>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Library Research</h3>
                <p>Initial research done by literature study; searching through the internet about the city of Breda, and what interesting and appealing things Breda have. Moreover, research on the marketing aspects, general digital and traditional marketing strategies, and the marketing strategy of the city of Breda itself.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Field Research</h3>
                <p>This type of research will be where we collect the hypothesis for the creation of our media products. The types of research we will do in this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Survey:</b> We did a survey that is targeted at our target group, to understand their interests and needs, then analyzed the result to improve our media product creations.</li>
                    <li><b>Stakeholder analysis:</b> We did this research by maintaining regular communication with the stakeholders to see if our creations meet the needs of the stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Lab Research</h3>
                <p>Throughout the iterative media products creation process, we did several user testings after the products reach a certain stage of development. This research will be done to further analyze the interest of our target audience and improve the products to be closer to what the user needs.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Workshop Research</h3>
                <p>This research was be done by prototyping the media products we plan to make: flyer, poster, digital poster, cinematic video and trendy video for social media advertisement. These prototypes will serve as proof of concept to support our marketing strategy.</p>

            <div class="project-phase">
                <h2 class="phase-title">Gathering Footage</h2>
                <p>In order to gather footage, I went to Breda and recorded different sceneries of the city that I could later use for editing the video you are going to see below.</p>

            <div class="project-phase">
                <h2 class="phase-title">TikTok Videos</h2>
                <p>Given my enthusiasm for TikTok, creating TikTok videos was a key component of our strategy. These videos aimed to highlight the vibrant culture and attractions of Breda in a way that would appeal to a younger audience.</p>
