            </div>

                <h2 class="phase-title">Research 1 (Brand Testing Report)</h2>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal of this test is to know and understand how Nathalie Silverentand’s target audience perceives the current brand image that is created for her. In addition to that, this test would be a toolkit to improve the design of her branding to align with the brand image that she wants to showcase.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Method</h3>
                <p>For this brand testing, the research method used is Field research by conducting a survey that targets and involves a specific target audience: Gen Z, as the respondents.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Result</h3>
                <p>This brand testing was conducted for 1 day and by the end of this test, 23 people participated. This chapter will discuss the result obtained from the test, and the relevancy of the result to the three most crucial aspects for the branding of Nathalie Silverentand: logo, tone of visual (stylescape), and tone of voice. These points are each to be discussed sequentially.</p>
                
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Logo</h3>
                <img src="/assets/logo_chart.png" alt="Logo Chart" class="example-image">
                <p>The chart above shows the result of the participants’ reactions towards the potential logo of Nathalie. The responses were summarized: only 49% of the reactions are “Simple & Clean”, “Minimalistic”, and “Modern”. Therefore, the result for the logo is negative.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Tone of visual (stylescape)</h3>
                <img src="/assets/stylescape_chart.png" alt="Stylescape Chart" class="example-image">
                <p>The chart above shows the participants’ reactions towards the currently established tone of visual of Nathalie’s brand. The words: “Inspiring”, “Minimalistic”, “Modern”, “Professional”, and “Sophisticated” made up 80% of the reactions, therefore the result for the tone of visual is positive.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Tone of voice</h3>
                <img src="/assets/voice_chart.png" alt="Voice Chart" class="example-image">
                <p>The responses above are obtained from an open question in the brand test survey. From the total of 21 responses, 67% of the reactions were positive, therefore the result for the tone of voice is positive.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>At the end of this test, the goal of this test was reached, as insights regarding the target audience’s view on the current branding of Nathalie Silverentand are obtained.
                The result elaborated in the previous chapter directly influences the decision to conclude and finalize the three branding aspects for Nathalie. Therefore, from the result of this test, the tone of visual and tone of voice are positive to be finalized. The aspect that got a negative result: the logo, will therefore be improved through another round of iteration.</p>

            <div class="project-phase">
                <h2 class="phase-title">Marketing and content Strategy - Fully created by me</h2>
                <p>My plan and research for the marketing and content strategy:</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Target audience research</h3>
                <p>First, it's important to mention that the painter herself didn't know anything about her target audience so far. Nathalie has been painting for twenty years, but only recently started to dedicate more time to her art. Also, because Nathalie Silverentand is a painter of many styles and techniques, her artwork is very plural and change according to her inspirations, desires and commissions. Keeping this in mind, Group Expresso used tools as survey and research to base our arguments when defining her target audience.</p>
                <img src="/assets/ta_surve.png" alt="ta survey" class="example-image">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Survey Results</h3>
                <p>This survey was sent to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Young professionals in the engineering/technology industry in the Netherlands who come across art exhibitions promoted by their own company from time to time.</li>
                    <li>People older than 43 years who have genuine interest in art and have already bought art before.</li>
                    <li>Young and professional artists.</li>
                    <li>International and Dutch students at Fontys ICT.</li>
                    <li>People older than 43 years who live in North-Brabant area.</li>
                </ul></p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Survey Conclusion</h3>
                <p>According to the survey results, Nathalie Silverentand’s target audience would be, in the first place, Gen Z (people from 15 to 25), and, in second place, people older than 43 years old. As an agreement between the group and stakeholders, we concluded that a survey wouldn't be enough to define her target audience, although, we should consider Gen Z for this content strategy.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Research on competitors</h3>
                <p>Another approach to define Nathalie's target audience is doing research on her competitors. Who are they? Where are they? How do they reach their target audience? All Nathalie's competitors have something in common: a strong portfolio displayed on websites and social media platforms like Instagram. With that, it is easier to find more about the artist and their work. Competitors also seek gaining more exposure in local exhibitions and physical or online galleries. 
                <p>Example of some competitors:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://daanvanderlinden.nl/">Daan van der Linden</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://rutgervanbruggen.com/">Rutger Van Bruggen</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://heleenmos.com/en/">Helen Mos</a></li>
                </ul></p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">User persona</h3>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Marketing Strategy</h3>
                <p>Nowadays, especially with the current market on the internet, you should take use of the ability to provide High-Ticket Services – meaning rising prices and focusing on an audience that can pay for it. In simple words this makes selling your services easier, while bringing higher ROI (Return of investment), in which case your investment is your time and effort.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Inbound Strategies</h3>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Social Media</h4>
                <p><b>1. TikTok & Instagram Reels</b></p>
                <p>A platform for short videos. Ideal to make a video go viral, get inspiration from other artists and follow trends.</p>
                <p>TikTok video structure:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hook/Trends</li>
                    <li>Content</li>
                    <li>Close</li>
                    <li>Caption</li>
                    <li>Right use of hashtags</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Examples of trending hooks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Speed painting</li>
                    <li>Satisfying videos</li>
                    <li>Want X, then check this out</li>
                    <li>3 Reasons why I love X</li>
                    <li>Top 3 Reasons you need to get X</li>
                    <li>Watch this video if you need X</li>
                    <li>Before you scroll...</li>
                </ul></p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Organic Upload Guidelines</h4>
                <p>Upload 1-3 videos a day (not less-not more than that). Keep the uploads few hours apart. Including trending sounds and hashtags. We do those things, so the algorithm doesn’t detect you as a robot that spams videos and pushes yours to a wider audience.</p>
                <img src="/assets/tiktok_ad_guide.png" alt="TikTok Ad Guide" class="example-image">
                <p>I also made a detailed step by step guide on how to exactly run TikTok ads.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Outbound Strategies</h3>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Cold Outreach</h4>
                <p>A good and solid method that’s the base of many businesses marketing is cold outreach. This can be with both sending emails or just dialing them on the phone. Cold calling means to approach a prospect (potential client) without them knowing you beforehand and offering your services. This process may seem scary at first but is a quite widespread practice. Below, we have examples of businesses you can approach.</p>
                
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Rental Art Agencies</h4>
                <p>These rental art agencies intermediate between the artist and businesses or customers interested in renting art to their place. This can be a good idea as events may require art for nice decorations, or companies that are in a certain city/country for a limited period, etc.</p>
                <p>Some of the Dutch Rental Art Agencies to outreach:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.sbk.nl/">SBK</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.abrahamart.com/">Abraham Art</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.degaleriedenhaag.nl/">De Galerie Den Haag</a></li>
                </ul></p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Online Galleries</h4>
                <p>An artist needs exposure through their artworks, that's why there are online galleries services that can help as a search engine as well. Artsper and artgallery.co.uk, for example, offer this kind of services with memberships. Other point to take into consideration is getting in touch with the community who are already part of these galleries.</p>
                <img src="/assets/outreach_guide.png" alt="Outreach Guide" class="example-image">
                <p>And of course, I provided her with a step by step guide on how to outreach to local businesses.</p>
